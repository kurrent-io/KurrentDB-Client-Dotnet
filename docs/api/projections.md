# Projection management

The client provides a way to manage projections in EventStoreDB. 

For a detailed explanation of projections, see the [server documentation](@server/features/projections/README.md).

## Required packages

Add the .NET `EventStore.Client.Grpc` and `EventStore.Client.Grpc.ProjectionManagement` package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package EventStoreDB.Client
dotnet add package EventStore.Client.Grpc.ProjectionManagement
```

## Creating a client

Projection management operations are exposed through the dedicated client.

```cs
var settings = EventStoreClientSettings.Create(connection);
settings.ConnectionName = "Projection management client";
settings.DefaultCredentials = new UserCredentials("admin", "changeit");
var managementClient = new EventStoreProjectionManagementClient(settings);
```

## Create a projection

Creates a projection that runs until the last event in the store, and then continues processing new events as they are appended to the store. The query parameter contains the JavaScript you want created as a projection.
Projections have explicit names, and you can enable or disable them via this name.

```cs
const string js = """
  fromAll()
    .when({
      $init: function() {
        return {
          count: 0
        };
      },
      $any: function(s, e) {
        s.count += 1;
      }
    })
    .outputState();
""";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync("count-events", js);
```

Trying to create projections with the same name will result in an error:

```cs
var name = "count-events";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);
try {
  await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.AlreadyExists) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("Conflict")) { // will be removed in a future release
  var format = $"{name} already exists";
  Console.WriteLine(format);
}
```

## Restart the subsystem

It is possible to restart the entire projection subsystem using the projections management client API. The user must be in the `$ops` or `$admin` group to perform this operation.

```cs
await managementClient.RestartSubsystemAsync();
```

## Enable a projection

Enables an existing projection by name.
Once enabled, the projection will start to process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to enable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

```cs
await managementClient.EnableAsync("$by_category");
```

You can only enable an existing projection. When you try to enable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

 ```cs
try {
  await managementClient.EnableAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Disable a projection

Disables a projection, this will save the projection checkpoint.
Once disabled, the projection will not process events even after restarting the server or the projection subsystem.
You must have access to a projection to disable it, see the [ACL documentation](@server/security/user-authorization.md).

```cs
await managementClient.DisableAsync("$by_category");
```

You can only disable an existing projection. When you try to disable a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await managementClient.DisableAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Delete a projection

This feature is currently not supported by the client.  

## Abort a projection

Aborts a projection, this will not save the projection's checkpoint.

```cs
await managementClient.AbortAsync("countEvents_Abort");
```

You can only abort an existing projection. When you try to abort a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await managementClient.AbortAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Reset a projection

Resets a projection, which causes deleting the projection checkpoint. This will force the projection to start afresh and re-emit events. Streams that are written to from the projection will also be soft-deleted.

```cs
await managementClient.ResetAsync("countEvents_Reset");
```

Resetting a projection that does not exist will result in an error.

```cs
try {
  await managementClient.ResetAsync("projection that does not exists");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

## Update a projection

Updates a projection with a given name. The query parameter contains the new JavaScript. Updating system projections using this operation is not supported at the moment.

```cs
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
      $init: function() {
          return {
              count: 0
          };
      },
      $any: function(s, e) {
          s.count += 1;
      }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, "fromAll().when()");
await managementClient.UpdateAsync(name, js);
```

You can only update an existing projection. When you try to update a non-existing projection, you'll get an error:

```cs
try {
  await managementClient.UpdateAsync("Update Not existing projection", "fromAll().when()");
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode is StatusCode.NotFound) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
catch (RpcException e) when (e.Message.Contains("NotFound")) { // will be removed in a future release
  Console.WriteLine("'Update Not existing projection' does not exists and can not be updated");
}
```

## List all projections

Returns a list of all projections, user defined & system projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs
var details = managementClient.ListAllAsync();

await foreach (var detail in details)
  Console.WriteLine(
    $@"{detail.Name}, {detail.Status}, {detail.CheckpointStatus}, {detail.Mode}, {detail.Progress}"
  );
```

## List continuous projections

Returns a list of all continuous projections.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs
var details = managementClient.ListContinuousAsync();
await foreach (var detail in details)
  Console.WriteLine(
    $@"{detail.Name}, {detail.Status}, {detail.CheckpointStatus}, {detail.Mode}, {detail.Progress}"
  );
```

## Get status

Gets the status of a named projection.
See the [projection details](#projection-details) section for an explanation of the returned values.

```cs
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(state, event) {
      state.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);
var status = await managementClient.GetStatusAsync(name);
Console.WriteLine(
  $@"{status?.Name}, {status?.Status}, {status?.CheckpointStatus}, {status?.Mode}, {status?.Progress}"
);
```

## Get state

Retrieves the state of a projection.

```cs
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(s, e) {
      s.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = $"count-events";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);

//give it some time to process and have a state.
await Task.Delay(500);

var stateDocument = await managementClient.GetStateAsync(name);
var result        = await managementClient.GetStateAsync<Result>(name);

Console.WriteLine(DocToString(stateDocument));
Console.WriteLine(result);

static async Task<string> DocToString(JsonDocument d) {
  await using var stream = new MemoryStream();
  var writer = new Utf8JsonWriter(stream, new JsonWriterOptions { Indented = false });
  d.WriteTo(writer);
  await writer.FlushAsync();
  return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(stream.ToArray());
}
```

## Get result

Retrieves the result of the named projection and partition.

```cs
const string js = """
fromAll()
  .when({
    $init: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    $any: function(s, e) {
      s.count += 1;
    }
  })
  .outputState();
""";

var name = "count-events";

await managementClient.CreateContinuousAsync(name, js);

await Task.Delay(500); //give it some time to have a result.

// Results are retrieved either as  JsonDocument or a typed result 
var document = await managementClient.GetResultAsync(name);
var result   = await managementClient.GetResultAsync<Result>(name);

Console.WriteLine(DocToString(document));
Console.WriteLine(result);

static string DocToString(JsonDocument d) {
  using var stream = new MemoryStream();
  using var writer = new Utf8JsonWriter(stream, new JsonWriterOptions { Indented = false });
  d.WriteTo(writer);
  writer.Flush();
  return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(stream.ToArray());
}
```
