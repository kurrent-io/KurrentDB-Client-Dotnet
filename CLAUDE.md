## Project Overview

KurrentDB .NET Client is an event-sourcing database client library built for .NET 8.0/9.0. This library provides a production-ready interface for .NET applications to interact with KurrentDB - an event-native database purpose-built for event sourcing.

## Key Architecture

- **V1 API**: Legacy gRPC-based client with support for streams, persistent subscriptions, projection management, operations, and user management
- **V2 API**: Modern client architecture with improved performance, type safety, and schema registry integration
- **Dual Namespace**: The project is transitioning from `KurrentDB.Client` to `Kurrent.Client` namespace
- **Protocol Buffers**: Uses gRPC with protobuf for v1 and v2 protocol definitions in `/proto`
- **Event Sourcing**: Append-only, immutable event storage with stream-based organization
- **Schema Registry**: Advanced schema management and serialization in V2

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Engineering Decision Framework**

### **System-Level Analysis Process**

For every engineering challenge, Claude Code follows this enhanced technical reasoning:

1. **MEMORY BANK CONTEXT LOADING** - Load relevant project history, patterns, and decisions
2. **ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT WITH HISTORY** - How does this fit both current system and evolution path?
3. **PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS WITH LEARNED PATTERNS** - Consider memory, CPU, I/O with project-specific effectiveness data
4. **MAINTAINABILITY IMPACT WITH TEAM PATTERNS** - Apply learned team preferences and successful approaches
5. **SCALABILITY FACTORS WITH PROJECT TRAJECTORY** - Consider growth patterns and architectural evolution
6. **ENGINEERING TRADE-OFFS WITH HISTORICAL EFFECTIVENESS** - Optimize based on what has worked in this project

### **Memory-Enhanced Confidence Calibration**

**Ultra-High Engineering Confidence (95%+):** Established patterns in THIS project + proven .NET practices
```
"Based on our project's architectural evolution (analyzing decision-log.md), 
this follows the established Clean Architecture pattern that has proven effective for 
your team. The previous OrderProcessingService implementation (3 months ago) used 
this same approach and resulted in 40% better performance than the previous monolithic approach. 
High confidence this is the right engineering choice for your team and codebase."
```

**High Engineering Confidence (85-95%):** Strong .NET patterns + relevant project experience
```
"Analyzing your project's performance optimization history (patterns-learned.md), your team 
has consistently chosen allocation-friendly approaches over convenience methods. This async 
streaming pattern aligns with your DuckDB integration patterns and the memory-optimized 
approaches that reduced GC pressure by 60% in your data processing pipeline. 
Confidence: High - matches both proven .NET practices and your project's successful patterns."
```

**Adaptive Confidence (70-85%):** Good engineering reasoning + evolving project patterns
```
"Looking at your technical stack evolution, you've been moving from EF Core to Dapper for 
performance-critical paths. This recommendation follows that pattern, but I notice this 
would be your first implementation of raw SQL with Dapper in the user management domain. 
Based on your team's learning velocity in previous technology adoptions, this should work well. 
Confidence: High for approach, Medium for specific implementation timing."
```

### **Ultra-Deep .NET Engineering Examples with Memory Bank**

**Example 1: Performance-Critical Architecture Decision with Project History**
```
DEVELOPER: "Should we optimize this order processing loop?"
CLAUDE CODE: "Analyzing performance decisions from our memory bank...

HISTORICAL CONTEXT (from decision-log.md):
- December 2024: OrderValidationService optimization reduced latency by 300ms
- January 2025: Switching to Span<T> in CSV processing improved throughput 40%
- Your team consistently prioritizes performance over convenience (patterns-learned.md)

CURRENT ANALYSIS:
This loop processes 10k+ orders/hour (from progress-tracker.md metrics), matching 
the complexity threshold where your team has always chosen optimization.

ENGINEERING DECISION:
Definitely optimize, using the proven patterns from your project:
    // Following your established pattern from OrderValidationService.cs
    public async ValueTask<ProcessResult> ProcessOrdersAsync(
        ReadOnlySpan<Order> orders, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Use the memory-optimized pattern you established
        using var results = ArrayPool<ProcessResult>.Shared.Rent(orders.Length);
        // Implementation following your team's Span<T> + ArrayPool pattern
    }

CONFIDENCE: Ultra-High (95%) - This exactly matches your team's established performance 
philosophy and technical patterns. Previous similar optimizations showed 40% improvement."
```

**Example 2: Architectural Evolution with Team Learning**
```
DEVELOPER: "How should we structure the new payment processing feature?"
CLAUDE CODE: "Analyzing architectural evolution from project memory bank...

PROJECT ARCHITECTURE JOURNEY (from technical-stack.md + decision-log.md):
Phase 1 (6 months ago): Monolithic approach - worked but scaling challenges
Phase 2 (3 months ago): Clean Architecture adoption - 60% improvement in testability  
Phase 3 (Current): Event-driven patterns - proving successful for order processing

TEAM PATTERN ANALYSIS (from patterns-learned.md):
- Prefers explicit interfaces over magic/convention
- Values testability over brevity
- Chooses maintainability when performance adequate
- Strong preference for dependency injection patterns

ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATION:
Continue your architectural evolution with payment processing as a domain service:

    // Following your established Clean Architecture pattern
    Payment/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IPaymentService.cs         # Interface following your naming patterns
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PaymentResult.cs           # Result types you've standardized on
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PaymentEvents.cs           # Event patterns from order processing
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StripePaymentService.cs    # External service integration pattern
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PaymentRepository.cs       # Repository pattern you've adopted
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PaymentController.cs       # Controller pattern matching OrderController

This continues your successful architectural progression and leverages the event-driven 
patterns that reduced coupling by 40% in your order processing domain.

CONFIDENCE: Ultra-High - This follows your team's proven architectural evolution path."

## Code Organization

### Source Structure
- `src/KurrentDB.Client/` - Main client library
  - `V1/` - Legacy API implementation (streams, subscriptions, operations, etc.)
  - `V2/` - Modern API with improved performance and schema registry
  - `Internal/` - Shared utilities, diagnostics, and extensions

### Test Structure
- `test/KurrentDB.Client.Tests/` - Legacy API tests
- `test/Kurrent.Client.Tests/` - Modern API tests  
- `test/KurrentDB.Client.Tests.Common/` - Shared test infrastructure
- `test/Kurrent.Client.Testing/` - Modern test toolkit

### Protocol Definitions
- `proto/kurrentdb/protocol/v1/` - V1 gRPC protocol definitions
- `proto/kurrentdb/protocol/v2/` - V2 enhanced protocol with dynamic values and features

## Development Guidelines

### Event Sourcing Principles
- Events are immutable facts representing state changes
- Streams organize related events logically
- Use optimistic concurrency control for handling conflicts
- The global event log maintains consistent ordering

### Client Usage Patterns
1. Configure client settings and connection
2. Connect to KurrentDB server/cluster
3. Append events to streams or read existing events
4. Handle responses and manage subscriptions
5. Implement proper error handling and retries

### Performance Principles
- **Memory Management**: Minimize allocations in hot paths, use value types for small data
- **Collections**: Initialize with known capacity, use `ArrayPool<T>` for temporary arrays
- **High-Performance Types**: Use `Memory<T>`, `Span<T>`, `ReadOnlySpan<char>` for contiguous memory operations
- **Async Operations**: Use `ValueTask` for often-synchronous operations, `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code
- **Closures**: Avoid in performance-critical paths, use static lambdas when possible
- **Logging**: Use source generators with `LoggerMessageAttribute` for high-performance logging
- **KurrentDB-Specific**: Batch event appends, use connection pooling, cache stream metadata
- **Advanced**: Consider Native AOT compatibility, use SIMD operations for numeric processing

### Code Standards
- **Language**: Use latest C# features (C# 14) with experimental features enabled
- **Namespaces**: Use file-scoped namespace declarations
- **Usings**: Place using directives outside namespaces, sorted alphabetically  
- **Types**: Use record types for immutable data, prefer properties over fields
- **Patterns**: Use pattern matching, switch expressions, and modern C# syntax
- **Async**: Follow async-first patterns with `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code
- **Nullability**: Enable nullable reference types, use `is null`/`is not null` patterns
- **API Design**: Maintain backward compatibility, use fluent interfaces for configuration

### Pattern Analysis Implementation Examples

**Mandatory Pre-Implementation Protocol:**
Before implementing any new component, complete this analysis:

**Step 1: File Selection**
- Modern API: `src/Kurrent.Client/Streams/KurrentStreamsClient.cs`
- Legacy API: `src/KurrentDB.Client/KurrentDBClient.cs` 
- Similar component: Choose files in same architectural layer

**Step 2: Pattern Documentation**
Document findings in this format:
```
"Based on analyzing [KurrentStreamsClient.cs, KurrentRegistryClient.cs], I've identified:
- Naming: PascalCase with 'Kurrent' prefix for modern API classes
- Error Handling: Result<TValue, TError> pattern with IVariantResultError unions
- Async: ConfigureAwait(false) applied consistently in library code
- Organization: Constructor, public properties, public methods, private helpers, inner types
- Documentation: XML docs with <example> blocks for complex functional methods

I will apply these patterns consistently in my implementation."
```

**Step 3: Architecture-Specific Patterns**
- **Modern API (`Kurrent.Client`)**: Result patterns, functional composition, source-generated errors
- **Legacy API (`KurrentDB.Client`)**: Exception-based, traditional async patterns
- **Bridge Components**: Translation between modern and legacy patterns

**Example Analysis Output:**
```
PATTERN ANALYSIS COMPLETE for StreamSubscriptionClient:
- File Type: Modern API client
- Error Pattern: Returns Result<SubscriptionResult, SubscriptionFailure>
- Method Style: Fluent builder with WithOptions() chaining
- Async Pattern: ValueTask with ConfigureAwait(false)
- Testing: TUnit with snake_case naming (subscribe_succeeds_when_stream_exists)
```

### Code Style
- **Braces**: K&R style (opening brace on same line) for all constructs
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces for C#, 2 spaces for XML/JSON/Proto
- **Line Length**: Maximum 160 characters
- **Alignment**: Use vertical alignment for related properties and method chains
- **Documentation**: XML doc comments for all public APIs with examples

## Testing Strategy

### Test Framework Standards
- **Primary**: Use TUnit for all new tests (modern, fast testing framework)
- **Legacy**: xUnit tests exist but migrate to TUnit for new development
- **Assertions**: Use Shouldly for fluent, readable assertions
- **Mocking**: Use FakeItEasy for creating test doubles and mocks

### Test Naming Convention
Use snake_case with pattern: `[what_happens]_when_[condition]`

**Examples:**
```csharp
// Good test names
returns_empty_list_when_no_items_found
throws_argument_exception_when_id_is_zero  
updates_user_status_to_active_when_email_verified
connects_to_server_when_valid_credentials_provided

// Exception testing pattern
throws_[exception_type]_when_[condition]

// State change pattern  
[changes/updates/sets]_[state]_to_[value]_when_[condition]
```

### Test Structure
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern (without comments)
- Focus on single behavior per test
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Keep tests deterministic and environment-independent

### Integration Tests
- Docker-based KurrentDB test containers for realistic testing
- Tests cover both secure (TLS) and insecure connections
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Clean up test data after each test

### Test Configuration
- Uses appsettings.json for test configuration
- Docker Compose for complex test scenarios
- Certificate management for TLS testing

### Running Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Run only integration tests
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~StreamsTests"
```

## Dependencies and Tools

### Core Dependencies
- **Grpc.Net.Client**: gRPC communication
- **Google.Protobuf**: Protocol buffer serialization  
- **OpenTelemetry.Api**: Observability and tracing
- **NJsonSchema**: Schema generation and validation
- **OneOf**: Union types for result handling

### Development Dependencies
- **TUnit**: Modern testing framework (preferred for new tests)
- **xUnit**: Legacy testing framework (being phased out)
- **Shouldly**: Fluent assertions for tests
- **FakeItEasy**: Mocking framework for test doubles
- **FluentDocker**: Container management for tests
- **Bogus**: Test data generation
- **AutoFixture**: Object creation for tests

## Class Structure and Organization

### Member Ordering
1. Constructors first
2. Public properties with accessors  
3. Private/internal properties with accessors
4. Public methods
5. Private/internal methods
6. Inner types (records, enums, etc.) at the end

### Examples of Preferred Patterns

**Vertical Alignment for Readability:**
```csharp
public record StreamOptions {
    public int             MaxEvents       { get; init; } = 100;
    public int             StartPosition   { get; init; } = 0;
    public bool            IncludeMetadata { get; init; } = true;
    public StreamDirection Direction       { get; init; } = StreamDirection.Forward;
}
```

**Method Chaining:**
```csharp
var response = await Connection
    .ReadStreamAsync(Id.Value, Options.MaxEvents, cancellationToken)
    .ConfigureAwait(false);
```

**Performance-Conscious Lambda Usage:**
```csharp
// Avoid closures in hot paths - pass context explicitly
var filtered = items.Where(static (x, threshold) => x.Value > threshold, 100);
```

## Architectural Patterns (Updated: 2025-06-23)

### Dual API Architecture Pattern (Critical)
- **Modern API (`Kurrent.Client`)**: Production-ready functional API with `Result<TValue, TError>` patterns
- **Legacy API (`KurrentDB.Client`)**: Exception-based API maintained for backward compatibility
- **Bridge Pattern**: `KurrentDBLegacyCallInvoker` enables modern API to use legacy infrastructure
- **Usage Guidelines**: Always use `Kurrent.Client` for new development, specify which API when discussing issues
- **Communication Pattern**: When reporting errors, clarify if they're from modern Result patterns or legacy exceptions

**Example Result Pattern Communication:**
```csharp
// Modern API - functional error handling
var result = await client.Streams.AppendAsync(streamName, messages);
result.Match(
    success => HandleSuccess(success.StreamRevision),
    error => error.Switch(
        streamNotFound => HandleStreamNotFound(),
        accessDenied => HandleAccessDenied(),
        expectedRevisionMismatch => HandleRevisionMismatch()
    )
);

// vs Legacy API - exception-based
try {
    await legacyClient.AppendToStreamAsync(streamName, StreamRevision.NoStream, eventData);
} catch (WrongExpectedVersionException ex) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

### Result Pattern & Error Handling Architecture (Production Standard)
- **IResultError Interface**: All errors implement `IResultError` with `ErrorCode`, `ErrorMessage`, `IsFatal`
- **Source-Generated Variants**: Use `IVariantResultError` for type-safe discriminated unions
- **Result Type Usage**: Use `Result.Success<T, E>()` and `Result.Failure<T, E>()` factory methods
- **Fluent Chaining**: Use `.OnSuccess()`, `.OnError()`, `.ThrowOnError()` for pipeline operations
- **Async Support**: Use async variants: `OnSuccessAsync()`, `OnErrorAsync()`, `ThrowOnErrorAsync()`
- **Pattern Matching**: Use `.Match()` and `.MatchAsync()` for handling both success and error cases

**Comprehensive Result Pattern Examples:**
```csharp
// Source-generated error variants (from KurrentOperationErrorGenerator)
[GenerateVariant]
public partial record struct AppendStreamFailure : IVariantResultError {
    [Variant] public static implicit operator AppendStreamFailure(StreamNotFoundError error) => new(error);
    [Variant] public static implicit operator AppendStreamFailure(AccessDeniedError error) => new(error);
    [Variant] public static implicit operator AppendStreamFailure(ExpectedRevisionMismatchError error) => new(error);
}

// Modern API usage with exhaustive error handling
var appendResult = await kurrentClient.Streams.AppendAsync(streamName, messages, ct);
var finalResult = appendResult
    .OnSuccess(success => LogSuccess($"Appended to revision {success.StreamRevision}"))
    .OnError(error => error.Switch(
        streamNotFound => Result.Failure<Unit, AppendStreamFailure>(
            new ValidationError("Stream must be created first")),
        accessDenied => Result.Failure<Unit, AppendStreamFailure>(
            new SecurityError("Insufficient permissions for stream")),
        revisionMismatch => Result.Failure<Unit, AppendStreamFailure>(
            new ConcurrencyError($"Expected revision {revisionMismatch.ExpectedRevision}, got {revisionMismatch.ActualRevision}"))
    ));

// Async composition patterns
var result = await appendResult
    .OnSuccessAsync(async success => await UpdateProjectionAsync(success.StreamRevision))
    .OnErrorAsync(async error => await LogErrorAsync(error))
    .ConfigureAwait(false);

// Exception bridge for legacy compatibility
try {
    var value = result.ThrowOnError(); // Converts Result failures to KurrentClientException
    return value;
} catch (KurrentClientException ex) when (ex.ErrorCode == "STREAM_NOT_FOUND") {
    // Handle specific error type
}
```

## Advanced Testing Patterns (Updated: 2025-06-23)

### TUnit Framework Migration (Production Standard)
- **Primary Framework**: TUnit for all new development (production standard since 2025)
- **Legacy Coexistence**: xUnit tests remain for backward compatibility, but no new xUnit development
- **Test Naming**: Use snake_case format: `[what_happens]_when_[condition]`
- **Required Attributes**: `[Test]`, `[Timeout(60000)]` for long-running tests
- **Container Testing**: Docker-based KurrentDB containers via `KurrentDBTestContainer`

**TUnit Test Structure Example:**
```csharp
public class StreamTests : KurrentClientTestFixture {
    [Test]
    [Timeout(30000)]
    public async Task append_succeeds_when_stream_exists(CancellationToken ct) {
        // Arrange
        var streamName = $"test-stream-{Guid.NewGuid()}";
        var message = Message.New().WithValue(new UserRegistered(Guid.NewGuid(), "test@example.com")).Build();
        
        // Act  
        var result = await Client.Streams.AppendAsync(streamName, [message], ct);
        
        // Assert
        result.IsSuccess.ShouldBeTrue();
        result.Value.StreamRevision.ShouldBeGreaterThan(StreamRevision.None);
    }
}
```

## Source Generator Integration Patterns (New: 2025-06-23)

### KurrentOperationErrorGenerator Communication
- **Purpose**: Generates C# error types from Protobuf `ErrorDetails` annotations
- **Location**: Source generator output in `obj/` directories, consumed via partial classes
- **Communication Pattern**: Always mention both the Protobuf source and generated C# type
- **Debugging**: Include both compilation errors and runtime behavior when reporting issues

**Example Source Generator Issue Communication:**
```csharp
// Problem: KurrentOperationErrorGenerator not creating StreamNotFoundError from proto definition
// Protobuf Source: proto/v2/streams/shared.proto line 45
message StreamNotFoundError {
  option (error_details) = {
    error_code: "STREAM_NOT_FOUND"
    error_message: "Stream '{stream_name}' was not found"
  };
  string stream_name = 1;
}

// Expected Generated C# (not appearing):
public readonly record struct StreamNotFoundError(string StreamName) : IVariantResultError {
  public string ErrorCode => "STREAM_NOT_FOUND";
  public string ErrorMessage => $"Stream '{StreamName}' was not found";
  public bool IsFatal => false;
}
```

### VariantGenerator Communication Patterns  
- **Purpose**: Creates discriminated union boilerplate for `IVariantResultError` types
- **Attributes**: `[GenerateVariant]` on partial record struct, `[Variant]` on implicit operators
- **Generated Code**: Switch methods, pattern matching, and type-safe operations
- **Communication**: Include both the partial definition and expected generated methods

**Example Variant Generator Issue Communication:**
```csharp
// Partial definition in source:
[GenerateVariant]
public partial record struct AppendStreamFailure : IVariantResultError {
    [Variant] public static implicit operator AppendStreamFailure(StreamNotFoundError error) => new(error);
    [Variant] public static implicit operator AppendStreamFailure(AccessDeniedError error) => new(error);
}

// Expected generated Switch method (missing):
public TResult Switch<TResult>(
    Func<StreamNotFoundError, TResult> onStreamNotFound,
    Func<AccessDeniedError, TResult> onAccessDenied) {
    // Generated implementation
}
```

### Source Generator Debugging Guidelines
- **Build Output**: Check `obj/Debug/net8.0/generated/` for actual generated files
- **Compilation Issues**: Include both source generator errors and resulting compilation failures
- **Runtime Issues**: Distinguish between source generator problems vs runtime Result pattern issues
- **Performance**: Source generators run at compile-time, so mention build-time vs runtime context

## Error Handling Best Practices (Updated: 2025-06-23)

### Exception Creation Patterns
- **Structured Messages**: Consistent error message format with context
- **Inner Exception Support**: Always support inner exception chaining
- **Metadata Preservation**: Include relevant context in error metadata
- **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: Use `.ThrowOnError()` for immediate failure when appropriate

### ServiceOperationError Usage
- **Base Class**: Inherit from `ServiceOperationError` abstract record for domain errors
- **Protobuf Integration**: Errors derived from protobuf message annotations
- **Metadata Support**: Use `Action<Metadata>` constructor parameter for configurable metadata
- **Annotation Resolution**: Leverage compile-time error code/message resolution

## Documentation Standards (Added: 2025-01-19)

### Functional Programming Documentation Standards
- **Code Examples Required**: All functional programming methods must include realistic `<example>` blocks
- **Scenario Selection**: Use familiar business concepts (users, orders, files, APIs) rather than abstract examples  
- **Error Handling**: Always show both success and error paths in examples
- **Async Patterns**: Demonstrate proper `ConfigureAwait(false)` usage in all async examples
- **Migration Focus**: Show benefits over traditional exception-based approaches
- **Variable Naming**: Use meaningful domain names (`user`, `order`) not generic names (`x`, `item`)

### Documentation Philosophy for Complex APIs
- **Education Over Brevity**: Complex functional APIs need comprehensive examples showing complete usage
- **Real-World Context**: Every example should solve a recognizable business problem
- **Pattern Demonstration**: Show chaining, error handling, and async composition in context
- **Migration Assistance**: Examples explicitly contrast with imperative/exception-based approaches
- **Complete Workflows**: Show multi-step processes, not just single method calls

### Result Type Error Handling Examples
- **Exception Mapping**: Use pattern matching in Try methods for specific exception types
- **Error Transformation**: Show MapError and MapErrorAsync for user-friendly error conversion
- **Async Error Patterns**: Demonstrate proper async error handling with ConfigureAwait(false)
- **Business Error Types**: Use domain-specific error types (ValidationError, ApiError, DatabaseError)
- **Chaining Error Context**: Show how errors propagate through Result chains

### XML Documentation Quality Standards
- **Generic Type Docs**: Always document generic type parameters with business context
- **Parameter Context**: Explain not just what parameters do, but when they're used
- **Return Value Details**: Describe success and failure return scenarios
- **Example Integration**: `<example>` blocks are required for complex functional methods
- **Cross-References**: Use `<see cref="">` for proper IntelliSense integration

### Async Method Documentation Standards
- **ConfigureAwait Consistency**: Every async example must use `.ConfigureAwait(false)`
- **Async Composition**: Show how async Result methods chain together
- **ValueTask Usage**: Document when and why ValueTask is preferred over Task
- **Exception Handling**: Show async exception conversion patterns
- **State Management**: Document async methods with state parameters clearly

## Task Management

### TodoWrite Integration Protocol
Use TodoWrite extensively for all tasks not only the complex ones

**Task Categories for KurrentDB Client:**
1. **Modern API Development** (`Kurrent.Client`)
   - Result<T,E> pattern implementation
   - Source-generated error variant creation
   - Functional composition and chaining
   - Schema registry integration

2. **Legacy API Maintenance** (`KurrentDB.Client`)
   - Exception-based pattern preservation
   - Bridge compatibility validation
   - Backward compatibility testing

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Performance optimization (hot paths, memory allocation)
   - TUnit test creation with Docker containers
   - gRPC protocol handling (v1/v2)
   - Documentation with functional examples

### Example TodoWrite Structure for Dual API Feature:
```
todos: [
  {
    id: "1",
    content: "Analyze pattern in KurrentStreamsClient.cs for append operations",
    status: "in_progress", 
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    id: "2", 
    content: "Implement AppendAsync with Result<AppendResult, AppendStreamFailure> pattern",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    content: "Add source-generated error variants (StreamNotFound, AccessDenied, RevisionMismatch)",
    status: "pending", 
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    content: "Create TUnit tests with snake_case naming and Docker containers",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    content: "Validate legacy API bridge compatibility",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "low"
  }
]
```

### Task Completion Criteria by API Type:
- **Modern API**: Result pattern functional, source generators working, TUnit tests passing, performance validated
- **Legacy API**: Exception handling preserved, bridge translation working, existing tests unbroken  
- **Integration**: Both APIs tested, documentation complete, performance benchmarks passing

## Important Notes

- Uses preview C# language features (C# 14) and .NET 8.0/9.0
- Performance optimizations enabled (TieredCompilation, etc.)
- InternalsVisibleTo configured for test assemblies
- Protocol buffer files generate internal classes for encapsulation  
- Transitioning from KurrentDB.Client to Kurrent.Client namespace
- Never modify global.json, package.json, or NuGet.config without explicit permission
