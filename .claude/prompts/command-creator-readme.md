## 📋 What to Expect

### Step 1: Task Questions
Claude Code will ask you **3 specific questions** one at a time:

**Question 1: Main Task**
- **Technical Analysis**: "Analyze technical debt in my codebase and suggest refactoring priorities"
- **Documentation**: "Generate comprehensive API documentation from my code comments and usage patterns"
- **Process Improvement**: "Review and suggest improvements to our CI/CD pipeline configuration"
- **Strategic Analysis**: "Analyze our git history to identify development bottlenecks and team productivity patterns"

**Question 2: Analysis & Deliverables** 
- **Technical Debt**: "Identify code smells, calculate complexity metrics, prioritize refactoring tasks, suggest architectural improvements"
- **Documentation**: "Generate markdown files with API endpoints, data models, usage examples, and integration guides"
- **CI/CD Analysis**: "Review pipeline efficiency, identify bottlenecks, suggest parallelization opportunities, recommend tool upgrades"
- **Team Insights**: "Analyze commit patterns, code review cycles, feature delivery times, identify knowledge silos"

**Question 3: Existing Tools/Processes**
- **Analysis Tools**: "We use SonarQube but want deeper architectural insights and custom metrics"
- **Documentation**: "We have scattered README files but need consistent, comprehensive documentation generation"
- **Process Reviews**: "We manually review our CI/CD performance monthly - want to automate this analysis"
- **Knowledge Management**: "Team knowledge is in people's heads - need to extract and document it systematically"

### Step 2: Research & Deep Analysis
**Claude Code will research using:**
- **Context7 tools** to look up analysis methodologies and documentation frameworks
- **Web search** to find current best practices and industry standards
- **Other MCP tools** to gather comprehensive context about your specific domain

You'll see Claude Code thinking deeply about analytical approaches and best practices.

### Step 3: Interactive Analysis Design
Claude Code will suggest analysis parameters and **continue the conversation**:

```
Claude Code: "Based on your technical debt analysis task, I recommend these arguments:
- --dry-run (mandatory preview of analysis approach)
- --depth <level> (surface/detailed/comprehensive analysis)
- --scope <area> (focus on security/performance/architecture)
- --format <type> (markdown/json/html report format)
- --actionable (include specific implementation steps)
- --priority (rank by impact/effort matrix)
Do you want to add, remove, or modify any options?"

You: "Add --baseline to compare against previous analysis"

Claude Code: "Excellent! Should we also add options for:
- Historical trend analysis?
- Team-specific recommendations?
- Integration with existing tools?"

You: "Yes, add --timeline for historical analysis"

Claude Code: "Perfect! Are you ready to proceed to the next step?"

You: "Yes, let's continue"
```

## 💡 Example Interaction (Technical Debt Analysis)

```
You: "I want to create a command to analyze technical debt in my project"

Claude Code: "What is the main task or analysis you want Claude Code to perform?"

You: "Analyze technical debt in my C# codebase and provide prioritized refactoring recommendations"

Claude Code: [researches technical debt analysis methodologies and C# best practices]
"Describe the specific analysis, thought process, or deliverable..."

You: "Identify code smells, calculate complexity metrics, analyze dependencies, suggest architectural improvements, and create an actionable roadmap"

Claude Code: "Are there any existing analysis tools, documentation standards..."

You: "We use SonarQube for basic metrics but want deeper architectural insights and strategic recommendations"
