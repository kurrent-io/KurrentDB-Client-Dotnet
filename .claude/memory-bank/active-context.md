1. **Schema Registry Enhancement** - Continue schema-registry-reloaded feature development
2. **TUnit Migration** - Progress xUnit ‚Üí TUnit test framework migration
3. **V2 API Development** - Advance Result<T,E> pattern implementation

### Blocked or Waiting
- **None currently** - Memory bank establishment is independent infrastructure work

## üîç Context Details

### Feature/Task Context
- **Feature Name**: Memory Bank System + Schema Registry Reloaded
- **Business Justification**: Persistent development context improves engineering efficiency and decision quality
- **Technical Approach**: Template-based memory bank with project-specific population
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Complete memory bank files with accurate project information
- **Testing Requirements**: Validate memory bank system integration with development workflow

### Technical Context
- **Architecture Impact**: Establishes persistent engineering intelligence for future sessions
- **Dependencies**: Requires accurate analysis of existing project patterns and preferences
- **Performance Considerations**: Memory bank should not impact development workflow performance
- **Security Considerations**: Memory bank contains project patterns, not sensitive data
- **Data Impact**: Creates new documentation structure for development context

### Team Context
- **Collaborators**: Currently individual engineering session
- **Reviews Needed**: Memory bank content accuracy validation
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Document memory bank system capabilities
- **External Dependencies**: None for memory bank establishment

## üö® Issues & Challenges

### Current Problems
- **None currently identified** - Memory bank establishment proceeding smoothly

### Technical Challenges
- **Information Completeness**: Ensuring memory bank captures all relevant project patterns
- **Accuracy Validation**: Verifying project analysis aligns with actual development practices
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Establishing update cadence for memory bank information

### Process Issues
- **New System Integration**: Learning optimal memory bank usage patterns
- **Documentation Standards**: Aligning memory bank content with existing documentation

## üìù Working Notes

### Investigation Notes
- **Project Architecture**: Dual API pattern (KurrentDB.Client legacy + Kurrent.Client modern) highly effective
- **Development Patterns**: TUnit adoption, performance-first optimization, Result pattern evolution
- **Current Evolution**: Schema registry reloaded features, comprehensive API cleanup
- **Quality Standards**: Docker-based integration testing, source generator adoption

### Code Notes
- **Dual API Pattern**: Exception-based legacy + Result pattern modern provides excellent migration path
- **Performance Focus**: Memory allocation optimization, async patterns, ConfigureAwait(false) consistency
- **Testing Strategy**: TUnit with snake_case naming, realistic Docker scenarios, comprehensive coverage
- **Source Generators**: Error type generation, variant pattern implementation

### Meeting Notes
- **Recent Insights**: Memory bank system provides significant engineering intelligence enhancement
- **Architecture Decisions**: Dual API approach enables gradual modernization without breaking changes
- **Performance Philosophy**: Measure first, optimize systematically, maintain developer experience

## üîÑ State Transitions

### Recent State Changes
- **Initial State** ‚Üí **Memory Bank Establishment** (2025-01-07 14:30 UTC)
  - Reason: Need for persistent engineering context and adaptive learning
  - Impact: Enhanced development efficiency and decision quality
  - Actions Taken: Comprehensive project analysis, template population

### Anticipated State Changes
