### ADR-001: Memory Bank System Adoption
- **Date**: 2025-01-07
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
- **Context**: Need for persistent engineering context across sessions to improve development efficiency and decision quality. Complex project with dual API architecture requires sophisticated context management.
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive memory bank system with project context, active context, progress tracking, decision logging, and pattern learning capabilities.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. **Manual Documentation**: Rely on traditional documentation and developer memory - rejected due to context loss
  2. **Lightweight Notes**: Simple note-taking approach - rejected due to insufficient structure
  3. **External Tools**: Use Notion/Confluence - rejected due to context switching overhead
- **Rationale**: Memory bank provides persistent engineering intelligence that improves with each session, enabling more informed decisions and faster context loading.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**: Enhanced development efficiency, better decision quality, persistent learning
  - **Negative**: Additional maintenance overhead for memory bank updates
  - **Neutral**: New system requires learning optimal usage patterns
- **Implementation**: Template-based memory bank with project-specific population and regular updates
- **Review Date**: 2025-04-07 (3 months)

### ADR-002: Dual API Architecture Pattern
- **Date**: 2024-09-15
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
- **Context**: Need to modernize API from exception-based patterns to functional Result patterns while maintaining backward compatibility for existing applications.
- **Decision**: Implement dual API architecture with KurrentDB.Client (legacy exception-based) and Kurrent.Client (modern Result pattern) namespaces.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. **Big Bang Migration**: Replace entire API at once - rejected due to breaking changes
  2. **Gradual In-Place Migration**: Modify existing API gradually - rejected due to compatibility risk
  3. **Version-Based APIs**: V1/V2 versioning - rejected due to maintenance complexity
- **Rationale**: Dual namespaces provide complete isolation, enabling zero breaking changes while offering modern patterns for new development.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**: Zero breaking changes, gradual migration path, modern patterns available
  - **Negative**: Increased codebase size, dual maintenance burden
  - **Neutral**: Bridge pattern required for infrastructure sharing
- **Implementation**: Separate namespace hierarchies with KurrentDBLegacyCallInvoker bridge pattern
- **Review Date**: 2025-06-01 (when V2 API reaches feature parity)

### ADR-003: Event Sourcing Native Architecture
- **Date**: 2024-06-01
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
- **Context**: KurrentDB is event-native database requiring client architecture optimized for event sourcing patterns rather than traditional CRUD operations.
- **Decision**: Design client architecture around streams, events, subscriptions, and append-only semantics with optimistic concurrency control.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. **ORM-Style Abstraction**: Traditional entity-based API - rejected as misaligned with event sourcing
  2. **Generic Database Client**: CRUD-style operations - rejected as not leveraging event-native benefits
  3. **Message Queue Abstraction**: Kafka-style API - rejected as missing event sourcing semantics
- **Rationale**: Event-native architecture provides optimal performance and developer experience for event sourcing use cases.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Positive**: Optimal performance for event sourcing, native event patterns, stream-based organization
  - **Negative**: Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with event sourcing
  - **Neutral**: Specialized use case (not general-purpose database client)
- **Implementation**: Stream-centric API with event append, subscription, and projection management
- **Review Date**: Ongoing validation with user feedback
