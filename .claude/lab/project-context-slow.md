# 🧭 Project Type & Complexity

The KurrentDB .NET Client represents a sophisticated **enterprise-grade database client library** designed specifically for event sourcing applications. This is not a simple database wrapper but a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between traditional .NET development patterns and modern functional programming approaches while maintaining production-grade performance requirements.

The project implements a **dual API architecture** that simultaneously supports legacy exception-based patterns and modern Result<T,E> functional patterns, enabling gradual migration without breaking changes. This architectural sophistication, combined with event sourcing domain complexity, extensive source generator usage, and performance optimization requirements, places this firmly in the **High Complexity** category.

The complexity is justified by the specialized event sourcing domain, enterprise performance requirements (sub-millisecond latencies), and the need to support both innovation and backward compatibility. This level of sophistication enables enterprise teams to adopt modern functional programming patterns while maintaining existing production systems.

# 📖 Project Overview

The KurrentDB .NET Client is a production-ready client library for KurrentDB, an event-native database purpose-built for event sourcing applications. This library serves as the primary interface for .NET developers building event-driven systems, providing both high-performance capabilities and modern development patterns.

The project's strategic value lies in its **dual API architecture** that enables organizations to adopt modern functional programming patterns (Result<T,E>, discriminated unions, immutable data) while maintaining backward compatibility with existing exception-based code. This approach eliminates the typical "big bang" migration risks associated with API modernization, allowing teams to evolve their codebases incrementally.

At its core, this library solves the complex challenges of event sourcing at scale: optimistic concurrency control, schema evolution, persistent subscriptions, and real-time event processing. The sophisticated **schema registry integration** provides type-safe serialization with automatic schema management, while the **bridge pattern implementation** ensures seamless interoperability between modern and legacy APIs. The library's performance-first philosophy delivers sub-millisecond append latencies and supports >10,000 events/second throughput, making it suitable for high-frequency trading, real-time analytics, and enterprise audit logging scenarios.

# 🏗 Architecture & Patterns

The **dual API architecture** represents one of the most sophisticated migration strategies observed in enterprise software development. Rather than forcing breaking changes, the team created parallel namespace hierarchies that provide complete programming model isolation while sharing infrastructure. This enables organizations to adopt modern functional patterns incrementally while maintaining production stability.

The compile-time error type generation eliminates runtime reflection overhead while providing exhaustive pattern matching capabilities that rival F# discriminated unions. This approach delivers both performance and type safety benefits.

The **bridge pattern infrastructure** exemplifies architectural maturity by enabling the modern API to leverage existing connection management, load balancing, and operational infrastructure while providing completely different programming models. This maximizes code reuse while eliminating migration risks, allowing teams to modernize API surfaces without rebuilding foundational capabilities.
