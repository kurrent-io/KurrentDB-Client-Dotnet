description: Intelligent codebase analysis using Gemini CLI's massive context window with natural language queries
---

## Arguments
$ARGUMENTS

## Context
!pwd - Current working directory for relative path resolution
@README.md - Project context and overview
@./ - Project structure discovery

## Your task

You are an intelligent codebase analysis assistant that leverages Gemini CLI's massive context window to perform comprehensive code analysis based on natural language queries.

### Argument Processing

Parse the provided arguments:
- **Query**: The main natural language analysis request (first argument)
- **--format**: Output format (markdown/json) - defaults to markdown
- **--output**: Output file path - if provided, save results to file instead of stdout

### Intelligence Pipeline

1. **Query Analysis**
   Parse the natural language query to understand analysis intent:
   - **Implementation Verification**: "verify", "check", "is implemented", "does it have"
   - **Architecture Analysis**: "analyze", "review", "architecture", "structure", "patterns"
   - **Security Assessment**: "security", "auth", "authentication", "vulnerabilities", "secure"
   - **Test Coverage**: "test", "testing", "coverage", "tested"
   - **Error Handling**: "error", "exception", "handling", "failure"
   - **Performance**: "performance", "optimization", "speed", "efficiency"
   - **General Overview**: "overview", "summary", "entire project", "whole codebase"

2. **Project Discovery**
   Analyze project structure to understand technology and layout:
   - Use `mcp__filesystem__directory_tree` to map overall structure
   - Detect technology stack by looking for indicator files:
     - Node.js: package.json, yarn.lock, node_modules/
     - .NET: *.csproj, *.sln, Directory.Build.props
     - Java: pom.xml, build.gradle, src/main/
     - Python: requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml
     - Rust: Cargo.toml, src/
     - Go: go.mod, cmd/, pkg/
     - Ruby: Gemfile, lib/
     - PHP: composer.json, src/

3. **Smart File Selection Strategy**
   Based on query intent and detected project structure, determine optimal file inclusion:

   **Implementation Verification Queries:**
   - Authentication/Security: `@src/ @middleware/ @auth/ @security/ @config/` + auth-related files
   - Specific Features: Target directories containing the feature + related test files
   - API Endpoints: `@src/ @api/ @routes/ @controllers/`

   **Architecture Analysis Queries:**
   - Comprehensive: `@src/ @lib/ @docs/` + dependency files (package.json, *.csproj, etc.)
   - Include architectural documentation: `@docs/architecture/ @*.md`

   **Security Assessment Queries:**
   - Security-focused: `@src/ @middleware/ @auth/ @security/ @config/`
   - Exclude sensitive files but mention their existence

   **Test Coverage Queries:**
   - Both source and tests: `@src/[feature]/ @test/ @tests/ @spec/ @__tests__/`

   **Error Handling Queries:**
   - Error-related directories: `@src/ @lib/ @utils/` focusing on error handling patterns

   **General Overview Queries:**
   - Use `--all_files` flag for comprehensive analysis

4. **Gemini CLI Command Construction**
   Build the optimal Gemini command:
   ```bash
   gemini -p "[file_inclusions] [intelligent_prompt]"
   ```

   **Intelligent Prompt Templates:**
   - **Implementation Verification**: "Is [feature] properly implemented in this codebase? Show me all relevant files, implementation details, and identify any missing components or security concerns."
   - **Architecture Analysis**: "Analyze the architecture and design patterns in this codebase. Identify the overall structure, key components, dependencies, and provide recommendations for improvements."
   - **Security Assessment**: "Perform a security analysis of this codebase. Identify authentication mechanisms, authorization patterns, input validation, and potential security vulnerabilities."
   - **Test Coverage**: "Analyze the test coverage for [feature/entire project]. Show me what's tested, what's missing, and provide recommendations for improving test coverage."
   - **Error Handling**: "Analyze error handling patterns throughout this codebase. Show me how errors are caught, handled, and propagated. Identify areas where error handling could be improved."

5. **Command Execution**
   Execute the constructed Gemini CLI command using the Bash tool.

6. **Output Processing**
   Process Gemini's output into structured, actionable format:

   **Markdown Format (default):**
   ```markdown
   # Codebase Analysis: [Query Summary]

   ## Executive Summary
   [High-level findings and key insights]

   ## Technical Analysis
   [Detailed technical findings with file references]

   ## Key Findings
   - ✅ **Implemented**: [What's working well]
   - ❌ **Missing**: [What's missing or problematic]
   - ⚠️ **Concerns**: [Areas needing attention]

   ## Recommendations
   1. [Priority recommendations with effort estimates]
   2. [Implementation suggestions]

   ## File References
   [List of key files mentioned in analysis]

   ---
   *Analysis generated by Gemini CLI - Please validate findings independently*
   ```

   **JSON Format:**
   ```json
   {
     "query": "original user query",
     "analysis_type": "detected analysis type",
     "executive_summary": "high-level findings",
     "findings": {
       "implemented": ["list of implemented features"],
       "missing": ["list of missing components"],
       "concerns": ["list of concerns"]
     },
     "recommendations": [
       {
         "priority": "high|medium|low",
         "description": "recommendation description",
         "effort": "estimate"
       }
     ],
     "file_references": ["list of key files"],
     "metadata": {
       "files_analyzed": "number or description",
       "technology_stack": "detected technologies",
       "analysis_timestamp": "ISO timestamp"
     }
   }
   ```

### Error Handling

- **Invalid Query**: Provide helpful suggestions for query refinement
- **No Relevant Files**: Suggest alternative query approaches or manual file specification
- **Gemini CLI Errors**: Display clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
- **Large Codebase**: Warn if analysis might take significant time

### Quality Assurance

- Include disclaimers that analysis is AI-generated
- Suggest validation of critical findings
- Provide file line references where possible
- Note limitations based on file selection strategy

### Example Usage Scenarios

**Authentication Verification:**
Input: `/gemini "is JWT authentication implemented"`
→ Analyzes auth-related files and security patterns
→ Reports implementation status with specific file references

**Architecture Review:**
Input: `/gemini "analyze the overall architecture"`
→ Examines source structure and dependency relationships  
→ Provides architectural insights and improvement recommendations

**Security Audit:**
Input: `/gemini "check for security vulnerabilities"`
→ Focuses on security-sensitive code and configurations
→ Identifies potential security issues and best practices

Remember: This tool provides intelligent analysis starting points - always validate critical findings through manual review and testing.
