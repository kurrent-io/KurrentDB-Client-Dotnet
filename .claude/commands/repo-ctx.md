## Intelligent Repository Context Building

You are building a comprehensive repository context document optimized for AI agent decision-making. This is **not** a human-readable analysis - it's a structured knowledge base that agents will reference to make informed decisions about code changes, architecture, and project strategy.

**IMPORTANT: Always prefer git-based file operations over filesystem operations for performance:**
- Use `git ls-files` instead of `find` for file discovery
- Use `git ls-files '*.ext'` for language-specific file counting
- Only fallback to `find` for non-git repositories
- This provides 10-100x performance improvement on large repositories

**Think deeply and thoroughly about this codebase analysis.** Use extended thinking to reason through complex architectural relationships, identify subtle domain patterns, and provide comprehensive insights that go beyond surface-level analysis. Consider multiple perspectives and analyze the deeper implications of architectural decisions.

### Phase 1: Smart Repository Profiling & MCP Enhancement

**Repository Classification**: Analyze the discovered complexity level and determine:
1. **Project Type**: (Library/Package, Backend Service, Frontend App, Fullstack, Tool/CLI, Data/ML, Infrastructure, Mobile, Desktop, Game, Other)
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Identify from initial file scanning
3. **Analysis Depth**: Based on complexity assessment
4. **MCP Strategy**: Use Context7 for technology documentation, Microsoft MCP for .NET/Azure/TypeScript, FileScopeMCP for dependency analysis

**Technology Documentation Enhancement** (Always use Context7):
- For each detected technology/framework, use Context7 to get current documentation
- Enhance analysis with official best practices and patterns
- Include relevant code examples and architectural guidance

### Phase 2: Advanced Code Analysis with MCP Tools

**FileScopeMCP Integration** (if available):
- Generate file importance rankings (0-10 scale)
- Map dependency relationships
- Identify critical files that require careful handling
- Create dependency diagrams for complex systems

**Business Domain Intelligence** (Priority #1):
- Extract domain concepts from code structure, naming patterns, and documentation
- Identify business entities, workflows, and terminology
- Map business logic locations and patterns
- Analyze API endpoints, database schemas, and data models for domain insights

**Architecture & Design Patterns** (Priority #2):
- Identify architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, layered, event-driven, etc.)
- Map component boundaries and dependencies
- Analyze design patterns in use
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

### Phase 3: Deep Technology Stack Analysis

**Microsoft Technology Integration** (if applicable):
- Use Microsoft MCP for .NET, Azure, TypeScript documentation and best practices
- Analyze compliance with Microsoft architectural patterns
- Identify modernization opportunities for Microsoft stack components

**Technology Stack & Dependencies** (Priority #3):
- Parse package managers and dependency files
- Identify frameworks, libraries, and tools with Context7 documentation enhancement
- Assess dependency risks and update needs
- Map technology choices to architectural decisions

### Phase 3: Quality & Risk Assessment

**Code Quality Indicators** (Priority #3):
- Identify testing strategies and coverage patterns
- Analyze code organization and modularity
- Assess documentation quality
- Evaluate coding standards adherence

**Technical Debt Hotspots** (Priority #5):
- Use git history analysis to identify change frequency patterns
- Find files with high churn rates
- Identify complexity hotspots
- Assess maintenance burden areas

### Phase 4: Agent Decision Support

Create structured output sections specifically designed to help agents make better decisions:

1. **Quick Reference** - Essential facts for immediate orientation
2. **Decision Context** - Architecture constraints and patterns to follow
3. **Domain Model** - Business concepts and their relationships
4. **Change Guidelines** - How to make changes safely in this codebase
5. **Risk Factors** - What to be careful about
6. **Incremental Metadata** - For future updates

```

### Execution Strategy

1. **Git-Optimized Analysis**: Always prefer `git ls-files` over `find` operations for 10-100x performance gain
2. **Adaptive Depth**: Scale analysis effort based on detected complexity
3. **Extended Thinking**: Use `--deep-analysis` flag to enable ultrathink mode for complex architectural insights
4. **Incremental Support**: If `--update` flag is present, focus on changes since last analysis
5. **MCP Integration**: Always use Context7 for technology documentation; use Microsoft MCP for relevant stacks
6. **Smart Tool Selection**: Leverage FileScopeMCP when available for dependency analysis and file importance ranking
7. **Output Optimization**: Create directory structure and save to specified path

**Success Criteria**: The generated context document should enable any AI agent to quickly understand the codebase's purpose, constraints, safe change patterns, and critical dependencies without needing to analyze the code from scratch.
