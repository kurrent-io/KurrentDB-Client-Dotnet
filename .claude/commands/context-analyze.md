## Your task

Perform comprehensive repository analysis using multi-agent approach with extended thinking for complex architectural insights.

**Think deeply about this codebase analysis. Use extended thinking to reason through complex relationships and provide comprehensive insights.**

**Note**: The --since timeframe argument will be passed to relevant agents for git history analysis. Technology detection and detailed context gathering will be performed by specialized agents as needed.

### Argument Processing

**Handle --help:**
```

### Multi-Agent Analysis Strategy

Deploy specialized analysis agents:

**Phase 1: Structure & Discovery Agent**
- Use LS and Glob to map directory structure
- Identify configuration files, build systems, infrastructure
- Catalog documentation and governance files

**Phase 2: Technology Stack Agent**  
- Parse package managers and dependency files
- Identify languages, frameworks, tools using targeted file detection
- Analyze containerization and deployment patterns
- Perform technology-specific file counting as needed

**Phase 3: Domain & Architecture Agent**
- Identify core domain models and entities
- Map business workflows and use cases
- Analyze architectural patterns and design decisions

**Phase 4: Quality & Operations Agent**
- Assess testing strategies and coverage
- Analyze CI/CD pipelines and deployment practices
- Evaluate code quality tools and standards

**Phase 5: Git Evolution Agent**
- Parse --since argument and set timeframe for analysis
- Examine git history for patterns and hotspots using specified timeframe
- Identify areas of high churn and complexity
- Assess technical debt and maintenance concerns
- Generate contributor analysis and recent activity summary
- Identify most changed files within the specified timeframe

**Phase 6: Multi-Perspective Synthesis**
- **Developer Experience**: Onboarding, readability, workflow
- **Maintainer Concerns**: Complexity, debt, refactoring needs  
- **Architect View**: Modularity, scalability, technical decisions
- **Domain Expert**: Business logic clarity and correctness
- **Performance Specialist**: Efficiency and optimization opportunities

### Project-Type Analysis Focus

**Client projects**: UI frameworks, build tools, bundle analysis, user performance, accessibility, client-side storage
**Server projects**: Databases, APIs, security, scalability, data protection, server infrastructure
**Tool/Library projects**: Developer experience, documentation, API design, distribution, package management
**Fullstack projects**: Both client and server aspects plus integration complexity, deployment coordination

### Analysis Instructions

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract --since timeframe (default: "1 month ago") and --output path (default: ".claude/memory-bank/project-context.md")
2. Think deeply about repository structure and project reveals
3. Consider multiple perspectives as you analyze each component
4. Use Agent tool to deploy specialized analysis agents for complex tasks
5. **Technology Stack Agent**: Perform targeted language detection based on initial findings
6. **Git Evolution Agent**: Use parsed --since timeframe for all git history analysis
7. Think thoroughly about architectural decisions and their implications
8. Adapt analysis focus based on project type identified
9. Generate comprehensive insights valuable for different stakeholders
10. **Save results**: Create output directory if needed and write analysis to specified file
