# Claude Code Command Creator - User Guide

Create powerful, environment-aware Claude Code commands with intelligent tool detection and ultrathink-powered analysis. The Command Creator helps you build custom commands that adapt to your specific Claude Code setup and leverage all available tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Run the command creator** in your Claude Code session:
   ```
   > /project:create-command
   ```

2. **Answer 3 simple questions** about what you want to build

3. **Watch the magic happen** as it detects your tools, uses ultrathink mode to design the optimal command, and creates a production-ready result

4. **Use your new command** immediately with your team

## üß† What Makes This Special

**üîß Environment Intelligence**
- Automatically detects available Claude Code tools (Bash, Edit, Web tools, etc.)
- Scans for configured MCP servers and integrates them seamlessly
- Adapts tool suggestions based on your permissions and setup

**üß† Ultrathink-Powered Design**
- Uses Claude's extended thinking to deeply analyze your needs
- Considers optimal command patterns and tool combinations
- Designs sophisticated argument structures and error handling

**‚ö° Smart & Simple**
- Default interactive mode for guided creation
- `--simple` flag for quick command generation
- `--dry-run` to preview everything before creating

## üìã Command Options

```bash
# Interactive guided creation (recommended)
> /project:create-command

# Quick creation with minimal questions
> /project:create-command --simple

# Preview the creation process
> /project:create-command --dry-run

# See all options
> /project:create-command --help
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Intelligent Tool Detection

The Command Creator automatically detects and leverages:

**Core Claude Code Tools (Always Available):**
- `Read`, `Grep`, `LS`, `Glob` - For analysis and file operations
- `Agent` - For complex multi-step workflows
- `TodoRead` - For task management integration

**Permission-Based Tools (Detected & Suggested):**
- `Bash` - System integration and dynamic analysis
- `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write` - File modification capabilities
- `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` - Research and external data
- `NotebookEdit` - Jupyter notebook operations

**MCP Tools (Auto-Configured):**
- Scans `.mcp.json` for configured servers
- Suggests MCP tools when relevant to your task
- Creates fallback behavior for environments without MCP

## üí° Example Workflows

### Creating a Code Analysis Command

```
You: /project:create-command

Creator: What task do you want this command to help with?

You: Analyze technical debt in my TypeScript codebase

Creator: [Uses ultrathink to analyze your setup]
I see you have Bash, Edit, and Grep available. Perfect for code analysis!

Creator: What specific output should this command produce?

You: A report with prioritized refactoring recommendations

Creator: [Continues guided process...]

Result: Creates `/project:analyze:tech-debt` with:
- Dynamic tool detection
- TypeScript-specific analysis
- Prioritized recommendations
- Built-in --dry-run mode
```

### Quick Documentation Generator

```
You: /project:create-command --simple --type docs

Creator: What should this command do?

You: Generate API documentation from my code comments

Creator: What should it be called?

You: api-docs

Result: Creates `/project:docs:api-docs` in seconds with:
- Intelligent tool selection
- Error handling for missing files
- Team-friendly output format
```

## üéØ Smart Command Categories

The Creator suggests optimal patterns for different command types:

**üìä Analysis Commands** (`--type analyze`)
- Uses `Grep`, `Bash`, `Read` for code examination
- Suggests arguments like `--scope`, `--format`, `--depth`
- Creates actionable reports with recommendations

**üìö Documentation Commands** (`--type docs`)
- Leverages `Read`, `Write`, `WebFetch` for content generation
- Suggests arguments like `--update`, `--format`, `--include-examples`
- Handles both creation and maintenance workflows

**üîç Review Commands** (`--type review`)
- Combines `Read`, `Bash`, `Agent` for comprehensive analysis
- Suggests arguments like `--checklist`, `--severity`, `--auto-fix`
- Integrates with existing development workflows

**‚ö° Optimization Commands** (`--type optimize`)
- Uses `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Bash` for improvements
- Suggests arguments like `--backup`, `--test`, `--incremental`
- Includes safety checks and rollback capabilities

## üåü Advanced Features

### Environment Adaptation
Commands automatically adapt to your setup:
